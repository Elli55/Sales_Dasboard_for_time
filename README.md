# Cocktail Bar Concept Analysis Dashboard

This dashboard is an analysis of my imaginary cocktail bar concept. The data has been collected and organized using SQL, and it resides on my personal computer.

## Features

The dashboard includes two filters:
1. **Product Name Filter:** Allows users to filter the data by the name of the product.
2. **Date Filter:** Enables filtering based on the specific time period.

Using these filters, you can see:
- The cost price of the product during that specific time period.
- The selling price of the product.
- The quantity sold during that period.

To visualize the quantity sold more effectively, I have implemented a donut chart, providing a clearer representation of the sales data.

## Data Management

All data has been structured in a SQL database, ensuring accurate and organized information for analysis. 

Feel free to interact with the dashboard to explore the sales performance of various cocktails in my imagined bar concept!
